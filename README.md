# Feature-Addition-to-H2-Database
Database Systems Implementation
The objective of this project was to study existing functionality and add new features to the open source H2 database.
The features added were:
1. The existing implementation of the h2 database allowed to drop only one column at a time. So in the  added new feature, the code was modified so that multiple columns could be dropped using a single alter table query. 
2. A new data type 'Enum' was added which provided the functionality to set a variable value from a set of predefined values.
